# MATH70072-Big-Data
This repository has for sole purpose the hosting of a dataset for Imperial's MATH70072 module Big Data

The data was first combined by [1] from three disctinct sources:
1. socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census [2],
2. law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey [3],
3. crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR [4],

Offline pre-processing was done to remove the columns which exhibited missing values, and we decided to keep only the first 53 predicting numerical attributes.
